# Algorithmic Run time complexity in big O notation.
This repository includes a project where I investigate the run time of different similarity algorithms (Jaccard and cosine Similarity) on a corpus using different data structures,and comparing the run time of each case. Also the use of map-reduce paradigm is implemented and the run time is invistigated.
